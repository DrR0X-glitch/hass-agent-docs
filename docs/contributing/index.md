# Developing / Contributing

**There are many ways you can contribute to help make HASS.Agent better for everyone.**

## Low/No-code ways to help out

There are lots of ways to help out with HASS.Agent even if you can't code. Here are some of the ways you can contribute:

- Submitting Github issues whenever you find an error or problem with any aspect of HASS.Agent. Use [this](reporting-issues.md) guide for more info.
- Helping other users of HASS.Agent with setup and usage. You can help other users in our discord server [here](https://discord.com/invite/nMvqzwrVBU).
- Adding and updating everything found here in the HASS.Agent Documentation. More info can be found [here](#helping-out-with-the-documentation).
<!-- - Translating HASS.Agent's app and documentation to reach more people. There is a specific guide for this, which you can find [here](translating/index.md). -->

## Programming / Developing

If you are a programmer and want to help out check out these sections:

- [C#](#c-and-windows-apps)
- [Python](#python-and-homeassistant-integrations)

### C# and windows apps

If you have experience in C# and creating native windows applications, we could use your help with creating the HASS.Agent client and the Satellite service. If you would like to learn more, check out the dedicated section [here](hass-agent-app/index.md).

### Python and Homeassistant integrations

If you have experience in python and creating homeassistant integrations, you can help us develop the HACS integration that connects to HASS.Agent. If you would like to learn more, check out the dedicated section [here](hass-agent-integration/index.md).

## Helping out with the Documentation

You don't need to be a programmer or developer to help out with the documentation. 99% of the documentation is written in markdown, which is a very easy and widely used markup language to add formatting to plain text. If you would like to learn more about markdown click [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/).

However the project does require that you understand the basics of git version control and using an IDE(VSCode is highly recommended). But there is still another way you can help out which is submitting simple github issues that explain the problem with the documentation and one of our developers will implement the changes for you. Check out the guide to reporting issues [here](reporting-issues.md).

### Editing the documentation yourself

If you understand the basics of git and can use an IDE(VSCode) then you can check out [this](hass-agent-documentation/index.md) section about contributing to the documentation.
