## Permalinks

Permalinks are permanent links that point to a specific section in the documentation. A permalink can point to any heading found in the documentation. If you are asked to provide a link to the place where you are having issues or want something new make sure to use a permalink. You can get a permalink by following these steps:

1. Find the heading directly above the section your are linking to.
2. Click the "P" icon to the right of the heading.
3. Copy the address from the top of your browser.

    For a faster way to get a permalink you can right click the "P" icon and select "Copy Link Address".
